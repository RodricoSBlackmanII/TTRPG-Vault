While the **Illinea Empire** sought to exploit the powers of the Kathali people, the reality of colonization was far harsher than anticipated. Over time, the land of **Alrathion** took its toll on the settlers. As the **Illinea Empire’s** influence began to wane, the Kathali who were brought to Alrathion began to change, adapting to the new, foreign environment in ways that even the Illinea could not have foreseen.

Centuries of isolation and exposure to a harsh, unpredictable environment led to the evolution of the **Kathali** people. These Kathali descendants found themselves physically altered, their once mainly animal forms becoming imbued with humanlike features. It is believed that this transformation was both magical and biological, with their adaptation to the land deeply influencing their forms. Over the course of generations, the Kathali began to embrace these changes, viewing them as blessings rather than curses, further distancing themselves from their ancestors.

As these descendants evolved, they began to develop their own unique culture, distinct from their predecessors. The core values of **Honesty**, **Family**, and **Balance** that would come to define the Kathali way of life grew from their earlier philosophies, but with a renewed focus on strength, unity, and survival in an often unforgiving world.
