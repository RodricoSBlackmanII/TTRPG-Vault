Blood is composed of two things:

### Type
Blood type is crucial when creating formulae, as they must be adjusted for the blood's type.

### Vraul
Vraul is the inherent energy with one's own blood. It can be utilized to create magical effects, whether throughout spells (Discovered newly) or through Formulae.
