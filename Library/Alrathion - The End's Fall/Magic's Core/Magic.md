*"What is fire? It it the ignition? It it the light it gives off? is it all of those and more? Just as we cannot truly define fire, we cannot truly define anything. We can only prescribe categories upon it. Nothing is stopping a fire from lacking light. We can only think it does."*
- Tunda Tunda of the Great Council

# General Overview
Vraul is the universe's lifeblood. Magic is a matter of your power over it.

There are three core aspects of any creation; mind, body, and spirit. Vraul is the linker between a spirit, the mind, and the body. Things do not necessarily need all 3, but often do have all 3. Plant life contains mind and body, without spirit. Apparitions contain mind and spirit, but without body. Automatons may contain body and spirit, but not mind.

### Neutrality. Purpose.
Being as such, Vraul has no express purpose. When a purpose is expressed, that Vraul shapes itself in the best way to communicate that purpose. Do not get this confused with things being perfect, or even the best. This means that whatever the user communicates is emulated. Like an artist: if you draw poorly, your audience will not be able to fully understand or exemplify your vision. The way Vraul emulates this is with a temperament. 

# Realm Knowledge

### Realms
Realms are the most important part of magic, as they define directly what you can and cannot do.

### Realm Level Descriptions

| Level Number | Realm Name                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------ | --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1            | Detection and Measurement   | The magician can determine the presence or absence of anything the Realm encompasses, with considerable precision, and can analyze it passively.                                                                                                            |
| 2            | Control and Diversion       | The magician has limited control over anything that falls within the Realm. This includes the ability to encourage its natural growth and to calm it, but not to create it or suppress it much below its natural level. This includes active communication. |
| 3            | Command and Simple Creation | With substantial control over the Realm on a local level, the magician can call up things that might exist, make them go away, repair them, or change their appearance or capabilities.                                                                     |
| 4            | Domination                  | Anything that lies within the Realm is open to command, and the magician can create all but the most complex manifestations of this aspect of reality.                                                                                                      |
| 5            | Complete Power              | At this level, the magicianâ€™s control of the Realm appears more-or-less complete. He can also remove or change individual features of the target, often in complex ways.                                                                                    |
| 6            | Transcend Limitations       | It could be nothing more than a wild rumor, or achieving it may be the lifetime ambition of every wizard. A expert can adjust the nature of the Realm itself, at least locally.                                                                             |

# Spell Composition
## Impulses (Verbs)
Impulses are the blocks, or principles that the universe uses to shape Vraul. I will use elements as examples, because though often closely related, they are not directly bound to them.  Some things are more easily communicated to the universe, such as Destruction. 

| Word           | Energy Cost | Realm Level/FP Cost |
| -------------- | ----------- | ------------------- |
| Communicate    | 1           | 2                   |

| Create/Destroy | 2           | 3                   |
| Dominate       | 3           | 4                   |
| Heal           | 1           | 3                   |
| Protect        | 1           | 2                   |

| Summon         | 2           | 3                   |
| Transform      | 3           | 4                   |
| Weaken         | 1           | 2                   |

## Aspects (Nouns)

| Word           | Energy Cost | Character Points Per Level | Required Realm |
| -------------- | ----------- | -------------------------- | -------------- |

| Water          | 2           | 1                          | Elemental      |
Time is immutable. It cannot be affected, as it itself is the container that holds Vraul.


## Modifiers

| Triggered Delay (Triggered by a simple action instead of time based) | +50%             |

### Creation
Impulses are often used alone, with the structure of 1 impulse (Verb) and 1 aspect (Noun) creating the vast majority of spells. Swapping them does not inherently reverse a spell.  Using the spell *Weaken Light* on a fire does not inherently end the fire. If you use *Weaken Body*, you may notice a fire that may not burn, or a fire that lasts a bit shorter than it would normally.

### Communication
How well you can communicate your will through Vraul is the most significant part of magic. Those that do not have a fully realized plan/usage for their magic but can communicate better see results. That is why having a better understanding of the realm means you can communicate it better. Articulation is important.

### Grimoires
As Vraul can be used to imbue something, mages can have a grimoire. To do this, they must encode a spell with their own understanding of it. To use someone else's encoded spell, they must roll a Thaumatology or appropriate realm roll. The result is based on the following table:

| Margin of Success | Description                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1                 | You can successfully decipher the spell. You may cast it one time with a -2 penalt                                                                                                                  |
| 2-3               | You decipher the spell.You may cast it one time with no penal                                                                                                                                       |
| 4+                | You decipher and make the spell your own. You may inscribe the spell into your grimoire and cast it at a later date (Which takes 1d days) or you may cast it without a penalty to roll for 1d days. |
