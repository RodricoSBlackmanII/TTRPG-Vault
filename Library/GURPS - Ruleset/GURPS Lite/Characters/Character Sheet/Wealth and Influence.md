### General Overview
Now you need to determine your position in your society: How much money do you have, what privileges do you enjoy, and how do others react to you?

### Wealth
Wealth is relative. A middle-class American lives in more luxury than a medieval king, though he may have fewer gold coins in his basement. It all depends on the game world. Personal wealth is rated in “wealth levels.” A level of “Average” costs no points, and lets you support an average lifestyle for your game world. The rest of these rules apply if you are unusually poor or wealthy, or have a source of income that does not require you to work.

| Wealth Level | Description                                                                                                                                                             | Points     |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Dead Broke   | You have no job, no source of income, no money, and no property other than the clothes you are wearing. Either you are unable to work or there are no jobs to be found. | -25 points |
| Poor         | Your starting wealth is only 1/5 of the average for your society. Some jobs are not available to you, and no job you find pays very well.                               | -15 points |
| Struggling   | Your starting wealth is only 1/2 of the average for your society. Any job is open to you (you can be a Struggling doctor or movie actor), but you don’t earn much.      | -10 points |
| Average      | The default wealth level, as explained above.                                                                                                                           | 0 points   |
| Comfortable  | You work for a living, but your lifestyle is better than most. Your starting wealth is twice the average.                                                               | 10 points  |
| Wealthy      | Your starting wealth is five times average; you live very well indeed.                                                                                                  | 20 points  |
| Very Wealthy | Your starting wealth is 20 times the average.                                                                                                                           | 30 points  |
| Filthy Rich  | Your starting wealth is 100 times average. You can buy almost anything you want without considering the cost.                                                           | 50 points  |

### Starting Wealth
“Starting wealth” covers both money and property. Start with the amount of money your wealth level entitles you to for your game world. Buy the possessions you want to start with. Any unspent money is your “bank account.” Realistically, if you have a settled lifestyle, you should put 80% of your starting wealth into home, clothing, etc., which leaves only 20% for “adventuring” gear. If you are a wanderer (pioneer, knight-errant, Free Trader, etc.), or Poor or worse, the GM might allow you to spend all your starting wealth on movable possessions. All prices in GURPS appear in “$”: a convenient abbreviation for any baseline unit of currency suitable to the setting. One $ may be one dollar, one credit, one copper piece, or whatever else is appropriate. Prices assume a typical sale made by an ordinary merchant. Tech level (p. 7) determines starting wealth, as technologically advanced societies tend to be richer. Below is a comparison of TLs and suggested starting wealth.

| Tech Level | Description                      | Cost     |
| ---------- | -------------------------------- | -------- |
| TL0        | Stone Age (Prehistory and later) | $250     |
| TL1        | Bronze Age (3500 B.C.+)          | $500     |
| TL2        | Iron Age (1200 B.C.+)            | $750     |
| TL3        | Medieval (600 A.D.+)             | $1,000   |
| TL4        | Age of Sail (1450+)              | $2,000   |
| TL5        | Industrial Revolution (1730+)    | $5,000   |
| TL6        | Mechanized Age (1880+)           | $10,000  |
| TL7        | Nuclear Age (1940+)              | $15,000  |
| TL8        | Digital Age (1980+)              | $20,000  |
| TL9        | Microtech Age (2025+?)           | $30,000  |
| TL10       | Robotic Age (2070+?)             | $50,000  |
| TL11       | Age of Exotic Matter             | $75,000  |
| TL12+      | Whatever the GM likes!           | $100,000 |

### Reputation
***±10 points/level***
It is possible to be so well-known that your reputation becomes an advantage or a disadvantage. This affects reaction rolls made by NPCs (see p. 3). The details of your reputation are entirely up to you; you can be known for bravery, ferocity, eating green snakes, or whatever you want. However, you must give specifics. Specify the reaction-roll modifier that you get from people who recognize you. This determines the base cost of your reputation. For every +1 bonus to reaction rolls (up to +4), the cost is 5 points. For every -1 penalty (up to -4), the cost is -5 points.

---
### Importance
Your formally recognized place in society is distinct from your personal fame and fortune.

---
### Status
***±5 points/level***
Status is a measure of social standing. In most game worlds, Status levels range from -2 (serf or street person) to 8 (powerful emperor or god-king), with the average man being Status 0 (freeman or ordinary citizen). If you do not specifically buy Status, you have Status 0. Status costs 5 points per level. For instance, Status 5 costs 25 points, while Status -2 is -10 points. Status greater than 0 means you are a member of the ruling class in your culture. As a result, others in your culture only defer to you, giving you a bonus on all reaction rolls. Status less than 0 means you are a serf or a slave, or simply very poor.
