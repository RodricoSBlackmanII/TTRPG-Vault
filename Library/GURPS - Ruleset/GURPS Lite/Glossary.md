### Glossary Definitions
##### Roleplaying Game (RPG)

##### Game Master (GM)
The referee, who chooses the adventure, talks the players through it, judges the results, and gives out bonus points. character: Any being – person, animal, robot, etc. – that is played by the GM or a player. 

##### Nonplayer Character (NPC)
Any character played by the GM. 

##### Player Character (PC)
A character created and played by one of the players. 

##### Statistics (Stats)
The numerical values that describe a character, piece of equipment, etc., taken collectively. Often called “stats.” 

##### Party
A group of PCs taking part in the same adventure. 

##### Game World
A background for play; a setting. “World” might mean “planet,” but it could also refer to a region and historical period . . . or an entire universe. 

##### Adventure
The basic “unit” of play in a roleplaying game, representing a single mission or plot. It might require several sessions of play, or just one play session. 

##### Encounter

##### Campaign
A continuing series of adventures. A campaign will usually have a continuing cast of player characters, and the same GM (or team of GMs). It may move from one game world to another, with a logical reason.
