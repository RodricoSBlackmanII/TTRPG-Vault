# General Overview

The life of an adventurer is not all song and glory. You get tired. You get your clothes dirty. You might actually get hurt – or even worse, killed! Fortunately, all these problems can be cured. Even death.

# Injuries

Wounds and ailments cause “injury”: a (usually) temporary loss of Hit Points. Thus, your HP score measures your ability to sustain injury; see [[Basic Attributes#Hit Points (HP) |Hit Points (p. 6)]]. If any injury reduces you to 0 or fewer HP, you will soon fall unconscious. You can even go to negative HP . . . but if you go too far, you risk death. For the average man, the difference between full HP and negative HP is one or two sword blows or bullets.

> [!General Injury] General Injury: Lost Hit Points
> Repeated wounding eventually causes anyone or anything to weaken and collapse, even if no single injury is very great. The chart below summarizes the effects of being at low or negative HP. All effects are cumulative.
> 
> | HP Condition                  | Effects                                                                                               |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Less than 1/3 your HP left    | Halve your Move and Dodge (round up).                                                                |
| 0 HP or less                  | Immediate danger of collapse. Make a HT roll at the start of your next turn (-1 per full multiple of HP below zero). <br> - Failure: Fall unconscious (or stop functioning if not truly alive). <br> - Success: Act normally but must roll every turn to continue functioning. <br> - Exception: If you choose **Do Nothing** and do not attempt defense rolls, you remain conscious without rolling. Roll only on turns where you defend or choose a maneuver other than ** Do Nothing**. |
| -1×HP                        | In addition to the above effects, make an immediate HT roll or die. <br> - Failure by 1-2: You’re dying but not dead (see [Mortal Wounds](#^e73111)). <br> - Success: Continue to act normally until failing a HT roll and collapsing. <br> - Roll again each time you suffer further injury equal to a multiple of your HP (e.g., -11 HP, -22 HP, etc., for 11 HP). |
| -5×HP                        | Immediate death. You have lost a total of ***6 times your HP***.  Nobody can survive that much injury!                                                    |
| -10×HP                       | Total bodily destruction if the damage source makes this plausible: <br> - 200 points of arrow wounds: A messy but recognizable corpse. <br> - 200 points of fire damage: Nothing but an unrecognizable lump of charcoal. <br> - Important for settings involving resurrection or reanimation. |

---

> [!Combat Shock] Shock 
> Whenever you suffer injury, reduce your DX and IQ by the number of HP you lost – to a maximum penalty of -4, regardless of your injuries – ***on your next turn only.*** This effect, called “shock,” is temporary; your attributes return to normal on the turn after that. Shock affects DX- and IQ-based skills, but ***not*** active defenses or other defensive reactions.

---

>[!Major Wounds] Major Wounds
> A “major wound” is any single injury of greater than 1/2 your HP. Any major wound requires a HT roll to avoid knockdown and stunning (see below)
> 
> | Condition               | Effects            |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| HT Roll Success         | No penalty beyond ordinary shock.  |
| HT Roll Failure         | Stunned and fall prone (if not already). Drop anything you’re holding. This effect is called “knockdown.”  |
| HT Roll Failure by 5+   | Fall unconscious.  |
| Critical Failure         | Fall unconscious.   |

---

> [!Stun Effects] Stun Effects
> At the end of your turn, you may roll against HT. On a success, you recover from stun and can act normally on subsequent turns. On a failure, you remain stunned; your next maneuver must also be ** Do Nothing**, but you get another roll at the end of that turn... and so on, until you recover from stun.

---

> [!Mortal Wounds ^Mortal-Wounds] Mortal Wounds
> If you fail a HT roll to avoid death by 1 or 2, you don’t drop dead, but suffer a “mortal wound.” This is a wound so severe that your internal injuries might kill you even after you stop bleeding. 
> 
> If you are mortally wounded, you are instantly incapacitated. You may or may not be conscious (GM’s decision). If you suffer further injury and must make another HT roll to avoid death, any failure kills you.
> 
> While mortally wounded, you must make a HT roll every half-hour to avoid death. On any failure, you die. On a success, you linger for another half-hour – then roll again. On a critical success, you pull through miraculously: you are no longer mortally wounded (but you are still incapacitated). You can also recover from a mortal wound with a successful HT roll whenever medical treatment or magical healing restores any number of hit points – even if you’re still in the negatives.
> 
> If you recover from a mortal wound, make a HT roll. On a failure, you lose a point of HT permanently. On a critical failure, the GM may apply an appropriate dis- advantage (p. 10) or some other effect (e.g., reduced appearance due to scarring)

> [!Death] Death
> If your character is killed, you may still wish to keep track of further injury. In certain futuristic or magical worlds, the dead can be brought back to life by prompt treatment, as long as the body is mostly intact (not reduced to -10xHP).
> 
> Decapitation, a cut throat, etc. can kill anyone, regardless of HT and HP. If a help- less or unconscious person is attacked in an obviously lethal way, he’s dead. Don’t both- er to roll for damage, calculate remaining HP, etc. Just assume that he drops to -5xHP.
> 
> This does not apply to a merely unaware victim. If you sneak up behind a sentry with a knife, you can’t automatically kill him. Game it out realistically. Since it’s a surprise attack, he won’t be hitting back: make an All-Out Attack! Your attack roll will almost certainly succeed. Your victim gets no active defense at all. You will probably inflict enough injury to incapacitate or kill him. But it isn’t *automatic*.
> 
> When a PC or important NPC is killed in any but the most sudden and thorough fashion, the GM should allow a “dying action.” If this is a final blow at the enemy, it should take no more than a turn. If it’s a deathbed speech, the GM should stretch time a little bit for dramatic purposes! This has nothing to do with realism, but it’s fun.

# Recovery

The Injuries rules may seem harsh, but don’t despair . . . you can get better!

>[!Recovering From Unconsciousness] Recovering From Unconsciousness
> Failure by 5 or more on a knockdown roll, a failed HT roll to stay conscious at 0 HP or less, and many other things can leave you unconscious. It is up to the GM to decide whether you are truly unconscious or just totally incapacitated by pain and injury – but either way, you can’t do anything. You recover as follows:
> 
> | HP Condition                 | Recovery Process                                                                                                   |
|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 or more HP remaining       | Awaken automatically in 15 minutes.                                                                               |
| 0 HP to above -1×HP          | Make a HT roll to awaken every hour. <br> - On success: You can act normally but are at half Move and Dodge due to being below 1/3 HP. |
| -1×HP or below               | Make a single HT roll to awaken after 12 hours. <br> - On success: Regain consciousness and act as described above. <br> - On failure: Cannot regain consciousness without medical treatment or magical healing. |
| Medical Treatment or Healing | If treated or healed, make a HT roll when you regain HP to wake up and act as described above.                    |
| No Treatment and Below -1×HP | Must roll vs. HT every 12 hours. <br> - On failure: You die.                                                       |

---

>[!Natural Recovery] Natural Recovery
> Rest lets you recover lost HP, unless the damage is of a type that specifically does not heal naturally (for an example, see [Disease, p. 32](#^8f91e5)). At the end of each day of rest and decent food, make a HT roll. On a success, you recover 1 HP. The GM may give a penalty if conditions are bad, or a bonus if conditions are very good.

---

>[!First Aid] First Aid
> The two main uses for First Aid skill (p. 14) are bandaging and treating shock. It takes one minute to apply pressure or a tourniquet to stop bleeding. This restores 1 HP. 
> 
> After bandaging, the aid-giver may take extra time to apply a more elaborate dress- ing and treat the victim for shock. He must keep the victim warm, comfortable, calm, and still. After the time indicated on the First Aid Table, below, he may roll against First Aid skill. 
> 
> On a success, the medic rolls as indicated on the table to see how many HP the victim recovers – minimum 1 HP. A critical success restores the maximum possible HP! This roll includes the 1 HP for bandaging; thus, a roll of 1 HP restores no further HP. On a critical failure, the victim loses 2 HP instead of recovering any HP at all!
>
> | Tech Level | Time per HP Restored | HP Restored         |
|------------|-----------------------|---------------------|
| 0-1        | 30 minutes           | 1d-4               |
| 2-3        | 30 minutes           | 1d-3               |
| 4          | 30 minutes           | 1d-2               |
| 5          | 20 minutes           | 1d-2               |
| 6-7        | 20 minutes           | 1d-1               |
| 8          | 10 minutes           | 1d                 |
| 9+         | 10 minutes           | 1d+1               |

# Fatigue

Running or swimming long distances, being suffocated, and many other things can cause “fatigue”: a temporary loss of Fatigue Points. Your Fatigue Points (FP) score starts out equal to your HT. Just as injury represents physical trauma and comes off of HP, fatigue represents lost energy and reduces FP. When you lose FP, keep track of it on your character sheet.

>[!Lost Fatigue Points] Lost Fatigue Points
> The chart below summarizes the effects of being at low or negative FP. All effects are cumulative.
> 
> | FP Condition                   | Effects                                                                                                  |
|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Less than 1/3 your FP left     | Very tired: Halve your Move, Dodge, and ST (round up). This does not affect ST-based quantities like HP or damage. |
| 0 FP or less                   | On the verge of collapse: <br> - Each FP lost also causes 1 HP of injury. <br> - To do anything besides talk or rest, make a Will roll (in combat, roll before each maneuver other than Do Nothing). <br> - Success: Act normally. <br> - Failure: Collapse, incapacitated until you recover to positive FP. <br> - If drowning, you can struggle but lose 1 HP per FP lost. |
| -1×FP                          | Unconscious: <br> - Recover lost FP at the normal rest rate. <br> - Awaken when FP becomes positive. <br> - FP cannot fall below this level, and further FP costs are deducted from HP. |

---

>[!Fatigue Costs] Fatigue Costs
> The following activities commonly result in FP loss.
> 
> <h5>Combat</h5>
> Any battle that lasts more than 10 seconds will cost FP – you expend energy quickly when you fight for your life! Those who make no attack or defense rolls during the fight are exempt from this fatigue, but other actions (e.g., casting magic spells) still have their usual FP cost. At the end of the battle, assess a cost of 1 FP plus a number of FP equal to the encumbrance modifier. 
> 
> These costs are per battle, not per 10 seconds of battle. A very long battle may cost more (GM’s decision), but it would have to run for 2 or 3 minutes (120 to 180 turns!) before extra FP costs would be realistic.
> 
> <h5>Hiking</h5>
> Use the FP costs for fighting a battle, but assess them per hour of road travel; e.g., one hour of marching with light encumbrance costs 2 FP.
> 
> <h5>Overexertion</h5>
> Carrying more than extra-heavy encumbrance, or pushing/pulling a very heavy load, costs 1 FP per second (see [[Physical Feats#Lifting and Moving Things |Lifting and Moving Things, p. 23)]]
> 
> <h5>Running or Swimming</h5>
> Every 15 seconds of sprinting, or minute of paced running or swimming, requires a HT roll to avoid losing 1 FP
> 
> <h5>Starvation</h5>
> A human needs three meals per day. For each meal you miss, take 1 FP.
> 
> <h5>Dehydration</h5>
> A human (or elf, dwarf, etc.) needs 2 quarts of water a day – 3 in hot climates, 5 in the heat of the desert! If you get less than you need, you lose 1 FP every eight hours. If you drink less than a quart a day, you lose an extra 1 FP and 1 HP per day. You can regain all FP lost to dehydration after a day of rest with ample water supplies. You recover lost HP at the usual rate.
> 
> <h5>Missing Sleep</h5>
> If you’ve been awake for more than your normal day (typically 16 hours), you start to get tired. You lose 1 FP if you fail to go to sleep, and 1 FP per quarter-day (usually four hours) you stay awake after that. 
> 
> If you’ve lost half or more of your FP to lack of sleep, you must make a Will roll every two hours you spend inactive (e.g., standing watch). On a failure, you fall asleep, sleeping until you are awakened or get a full night’s sleep. On a success, you have -2 to DX, IQ, and self-control rolls. 
> 
> If you’re down to less than 1/3 your FP due to lack of sleep, roll as above once per 30 minutes of inaction or two hours of action. This can be very dangerous!
> 

---

>[!Recovering From Fatigue] Recovering From Fatigue
> You can recover “ordinary” lost FP by resting quietly. Reading, talking, and think- ing are all right; walking around, or any- thing more strenuous, is not. Lost FP return at the rate of 1 FP per 10 minutes of rest. The GM may allow you to regain one extra FP if you eat a decent meal while resting. Certain drugs, magic potions, etc. can restore missing FP, as can magic spells. 
> 
> You can only recover from fatigue caused by missed sleep by sleeping for at least 8 hours. This restores 1 FP. Further uninterrupted sleep restores 1 FP per hour. 
> 
> You need food or water to recover FP lost to starvation or dehydration; see [[#Fatigue |above.]]

# Other Hazards

>[!Cold Hazard] Cold
> Cold can be deadly. Armor must be insulated or heated to shield against prolonged exposure to ambient cold. 
> 
> Make a HT roll every 30 minutes in “normal” freezing weather. For most humans, this means temperatures below 35°F. In light wind (10+ mph), roll every 15 minutes. In strong wind (30+ mph), roll every 10 minutes. Additionally, strong wind can dramatically reduce the effective temperature (the “wind chill factor”). Also see the modifiers below
> 
> | Situation                            | Modifier to HT Roll |
|--------------------------------------|----------------------|
| Light or no clothing                 | -5                  |
| Ordinary winter clothing             | +0                  |
| “Arctic” clothing                    | +5                  |
| Heated suit                          | +10                 |
| Wet clothes (additional penalty)     | -5                  |
| Every 10° below 0°F effective temperature | -1             |
>
> Failure costs 1 FP. As usual, once you go below 0 FP, you will start to lose 1 HP per FP. Recovery of FP or HP lost to cold requires adequate shelter and a heat source (flame, electric heat, body warmth, etc.).

---

>[!Collisions And Falls] Collisions and Falls
> An object or person’s Hit Points and velocity determine collision damage. “Velocity” is how fast the character or object is moving in yards per second (2 mph = 1 yard per second). An object in a collision inflicts dice of crushing damage equal to (HP x velocity)/100. If this is less than 1d, treat it as 1d-2. 
> 
> If a moving object hits a stationary object that is too big to push aside – like the ground, a mountain, or an iceberg – it inflicts its usual collision damage on that object and on itself. If the obstacle is break- able, the moving object cannot inflict or take more damage than the obstacle’s HP + DR.
> 
> <h5>Falling</h5>
> A fall is a collision with an immovable object: the ground. Find your velocity (in yards per second) when you hit using the following table:
> 
> | Fall Distance | Fall Velocity |
|---------------|---------------|
| 1 yard        | 5             |
| 2 yards       | 7             |
| 3 yards       | 8             |
| 4 yards       | 9             |
| 5 yards       | 10            |
| 10 yards      | 15            |
| 15 yards      | 18            |
| 20 yards      | 21            |
| 30 yards      | 26            |
| 40 yards      | 30            |
| 50 yards      | 33            |
| 75 yards      | 40            |
| 100 yards     | 47            |
| 1,000 yards   | 146           |
>
> If an object falls on someone, find its velocity on the table above and calculate damage as for an ordinary collision.

---

>[!Disease] Disease
> Maladies and strange diseases may affect adventurers in far-off lands . . . or even at home. The search for a cure – whether for the Princess’ wasting disease, an alien plague, or a terrorist’s bioweapon – is a wonderful plot device.
> 
> The important things to know about a given disease are:
> <h5>Resistance Roll</h5>
>  The HT roll to avoid the disease. Most diseases allow a roll at HT to HT-6. On a success, the victim does not con- tract the disease. On a failure, he does, but he gets further rolls – once per “cycle” – to throw off the disease.
>
><h5>Delay</h5>
> This is the incubation period – the time between initial exposure to the disease and the appearance of the first symptoms in those who fail to resist. This is 24 hours for a “generic” disease, but can vary considerably for real-life diseases.
>
><h5>Damage</h5>
> The disease’s effects in game terms. This is typically 1 point of toxic dam- age, but it might be higher – up to 1d – for virulent diseases. DR does not protect against disease! Symptoms (fever, sneezing, coughing, spots, rash, etc.) appear after the subject starts to suffer injury. Injury from disease will not heal naturally until the victim makes his HT roll to recover!
> 
><h5>Cycles</h5>
> A disease damages its victim at regular intervals until he makes a HT roll or a maximum number of cycles passes. The “default” interval between HT rolls is one day. The number of cycles varies with the deadliness of the disease; for instance, a potentially fatal disease might only inflict 1 HP per cycle but endure for 20-30 cycles.
> 
> Once the symptoms of a disease become apparent, identify it with a roll against Diagnosis. This cannot identify a totally new illness, but a good roll might give enough information to allow treatment. Appropriate remedies – herbs, drugs, etc. – can provide a bonus to the cyclic HT rolls to shake off certain diseases. At TL6+, antibiotics (e.g., penicillin) give +3 to recover from most bacterial diseases.

> [!Flame] Flame
> If you spend part of a turn in a fire (e.g., running through the flames), you take 1d-3 burning damage. If you spend all of a turn in a fire of ordinary intensity – or if you are on fire – you take 1d-1 damage per second. Very intense fires inflict more damage; for instance, molten metal or a furnace would inflict 3d per second! 
> 
> Continued exposure to a fire can result in intense heat that can rapidly fatigue you even if the flames themselves cannot penetrate your DR. See [Heat](#^e487a6) (below). 
> 
> A single hit that inflicts at least 3 points of basic burning damage ignites part of the victim’s clothing. This does 1d-4 burning damage per second and is distracting (-2 to DX, unless the damage simply cannot harm the target). To put out the fire, the victim must beat it with his hands. This requires a DX roll, and each attempt takes a Ready maneuver. 
> 
> A single hit that inflicts 10 or more points of basic burning damage ignites all of the victim’s clothes. This does 1d-1 burning damage per second and is very distracting (-3 to DX, except when rolling to put out the fire). To put out the fire, the victim must roll on the ground. This requires a DX roll, and each attempt takes three Ready maneuvers. Jumping into water takes only one second, and automatically extinguishes the fire. 
> 
> In all cases, remember to apply shock penalties to DX if the flame inflicts injury!

---

>[!Heat] Heat
> In ordinary hot weather, you will experience no ill effects if you stay in the shade and don’t move around much. But if you are active in temperatures in the top 10° of your comfort zone or above – over 80°F for humans – make a HT roll every 30 minutes. 
> 
> Failure costs 1 FP. On a critical failure, you suffer heat stroke: lose 1d FP. As usual, if you go below 0 FP, you start to lose 1 HP per FP. You cannot recover FP or HP lost to heat until you move into cooler surroundings. 
> 
> As well, at temperatures up to 30° over your comfort zone (91-120° for humans), you lose an extra 1 FP whenever you lose FP to exertion or dehydration. At temperatures up to 60° over your comfort zone (121-150° for humans), this becomes an extra 2 FP.

> [!Poison] Poison
> Poison can show up on weapons; on darts, needles, or spikes in traps; in food or drink offered by a treacherous foe; and anywhere else you did not expect it. 
> 
> The important things to know about a given poison are: 
> 
> <h5>Delay</h5> 
> Most poisons require a few seconds to several hours to take effect. This is nearly always true for digestive agents. 
> 
> <h5>Resistance</h5> 
> Some poisons give the victim a HT roll to resist. Make this roll after the delay, if any, has passed. There is often a modifier: a mild poison might call for a HT+2 roll, while one that is almost impossible to resist might require a HT-8 roll! HT to HT-4 is typical. DR never affects this roll. If you’re in a poisonous environment (like a gas cloud or toxic atmosphere) and make your initial HT roll, you must roll again once per second until the poison affects you or you leave the area. If the poison has a delay, roll after each delay period instead. 
> 
> <h5>Effects</h5>
>  The most common effect of poison is toxic or fatigue damage. Mild poisons might only inflict 1 HP or FP; more severe poisons might inflict 1d or more. DR has no effect on this damage. These HP and FP losses heal normally.

---

> [!Suffocation] Suffocation
> If you completely lack air you lose 1 FP per second. If you are drowning after a failed Swimming roll, you can get some air, but you also inhale water: roll vs. Swimming every five seconds; failure costs 1 FP  (see [[Physical Feats#Swimming |Swimming, p. 23]]). 
> 
> At 0 FP, make a Will roll every second or fall unconscious. Regardless of FP or HP, you die after four minutes without air. 
> 
> If you get clean air before you die, you stop losing FP and start to recover FP at the usual rate (see [Recovering from Fatigue, p. 31](#^aad2ed)). If you are unconscious, you awaken once you have 1 FP. If you were drowning, a rescuer must also make a First Aid roll to get the water out of your lungs in order to save you. 
> 
> If you went without air for more than two minutes, roll vs. HT to avoid permanent brain damage: -1 to IQ.
